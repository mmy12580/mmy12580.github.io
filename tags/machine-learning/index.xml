      <description>Introduction As a researcher, most time of my job is to build an appropriate AI prototype for specific tasks. To achieve a satisfactory result, an expected large amount of work i.e tuning hyper-parameters, balancing data, augmentation etc are needed. The most deterministic component of deep learning practice is choosing the appropriate optimization algorithms, which directly affect the training speed and the final predictive performance. To date, there is no theory that adequately explains how to make this choice.</description>

      <description>Data imbalance occurs when the sample size in the data classes are unevenly distributed. Such situation is encountered in many applications in industry. Sometimes, it could be extremely imbalanced e.g click-through rate prediction, fraud detection, or cancer diagnosis etc. Most of machine learning techniques work well with balanced training data but they face challenges when the dataset classes are imbalanced. In such situation, classification methods tend to be biased towards the majority class.</description>
