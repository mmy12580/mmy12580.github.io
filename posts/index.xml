      <description>Overview: Activation functions play a crucial rule in neural networks because they are the nonlinearities which have been attributed to the success story of deep learning. At present, the most popular activation functions are ReLU and its extended work such as LReLU, PReLu, ELU, SELU, and CReLU etc. However, none of them is guaranteed to perform better then others in all applications, so it becomes fundamental to understand their advantages and disadvantages in order to achieve better performances in specific applications.</description>
